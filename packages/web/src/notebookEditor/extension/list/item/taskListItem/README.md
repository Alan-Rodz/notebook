# TaskListItem

This extension enables the usage of TaskListItems, which are like regular
list items but with specific render behavior. These list items render an
input checkbox next to the text content TaskListItem.

It's used by TaskLists, as part of their content, and as
such, it requires that the extension is implemented to work correctly.
